Summary: What happened on January 10th in the Twin Cities.

### Previously

The Trump Administration [launced a surge](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-begins-surge-minnesota-trump-crackdown-somali-immigrants/) in Minnesota in December, with 2,000 officers [rotating through the Twin Cities](https://www.startribune.com/what-we-know-about-the-federal-ice-surge-in-the-twin-cities/601558958) over a 30 day period starting January 4. On Wednesday, Jonathan Ross, an ICE agent, [murdered Renee Macklin Good](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/08/questions-follow-after-ice-agent-kills-renee-good-in-minneapolis).

Last night, [30 people were arrested](https://www.startribune.com/ice-raids-minnesota/601546426) at the noise protest at the Hilton where ICE agents are staying.

### Today

A huge crowd gathered for a [massive Anti-ICE protest in Powderhorn Park](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/10/minneapolis-ice-agent-protest-renee-good-property-damage-officer-injury-canopy-hotel-depot). I couldn't make it, so I walked around NE with my tiny foster dog and we kept an eye out. It was good to see so many people keeping watch. 

### Tomorrow

Keep [patroling your neighborhoods](https://docs.proton.me/doc?mode=open-url&token=NQBEQE8K60#CljXjBjfCxDo).
