    <h3>Today</h3>
<p>Writing this post one day late on January 16th. </p>
<p>I keep seeing posts of people saying ICE is driving erratically. In my neighborhood Signal group that is enough for grounds of ICE suspicion. I haven't verified <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@raebaebae28/video/7595427621832330551?_r=1&amp;_t=ZP-9369ksPW8D8">this story</a> about an abduction after an accident, but it aligns with all the dangerous driving and the abducting people indiscriminantly. ICE agents are breaking windows, dragging people through those windows, and leaving the car where it is. </p>
<p>It's now very common to hear reports of ICE going door to door asking for papers from neighborhood chats.</p>
<p>Ken Klippenstein also published some <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/21-secret-ice-programs-revealed">leaked documents</a> about ICE's programs which include investigating political groups and placing plainclothes agents in transport vans and detention areas to gather information. Pretty classic secret police stuff. </p>
<p>Finally, I recommend checking out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTjlSehFdhk/">Suz Clark's account</a> of the shooting that took place Wednesday night. It is an account of horrible cruelty and tragedy.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Keep patrolling your neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Contact your local schools and see if they need help getting kids to school safely. </p>
<p>Talk to a person not on patrols and get them into patrols.</p>
<p>Find an organization doing food delivery in your neighborhood. </p>
<p>Contribute to rent assistance programs in your neighborhood. </p>
