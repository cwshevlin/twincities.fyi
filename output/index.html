            <section><h3>Today</h3>
<p>ICE will eventually have to face whatever justice the community decides, but on top of that everyone who has ever known them will be ashamed to have even the most tenuous connection with them. </p>
<p>Today at Wrecktangle <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTbqYWQgE_n/">a crowd intimidated an agent into leaving</a>. Small wins are good and I love a crowd yelling you're not welcome here. </p>
<p>On a similar note, I heard from a friend neighbors stopped an abduction at Longfellow Park by being loud and coming out.</p>
<p>These two events may be nothing, but I think when connected to the national context of <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/shocking-poll-shows-americans-have-completely-flipped-on-ice/">deep unpopularity</a> of ICE and the Trump administration, ICE may scare easily. </p>
<p>They might even be moving hotels for the third time since December, but no news coverage on that yet. If that's true, that would be a result of the incredible negative public perception of ICE and pressure on hotels who house them. Who wants to spend money at hotels that house the Gestapo?</p>
<p>Also today <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTeIhdvjLLG/">Aliyah Rahman was detained</a> by being pulled out of her car. She was on her way to a doctor's appointment, passing through the area with ICE activity. She is a US-born citizen. They will detain anyone. </p>
<p>I also heard of several heartbreaking abductions happening in my neighborhood today. I won't get into them because I think the action is the same: keep getting out as much as possible and get more people to show up. </p>

<p>Contact your local schools and see if they need help getting kids to school safely. </p>
<p>Talk to a person not on patrols and get them into patrols. </p></section>

            <section><h3>Today</h3>
<p>This is truly the biggest bunch of losers ever assembled. Imagine having so little going for you that you resort to terrorizing a city in Amazon Basics fatigues to grasp at a feeling of importance. </p>
<p><strong>The incident yesterday wherein ICE broke down a door with a battering ram was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ice-protests-shootings-minneapolis-portland-3f9db36657dda5bfebf9c240b6011ee5">confirmed by the AP</a> to be warrantless.</strong> This could mean that they are trying this tactic elsewhere. Make sure you know the difference between a <a href="https://40thward.org/2025/01/know-your-rights/">real warrant and a fake warrant</a> and <a href="https://unidos-mn.org/know-your-rights">know your rights</a> if someone shows up to your door. </p>
<p>State Senator Doron Clark, Council Member Jason Chavez, and Council President Elliot Payne <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTb3euHjonG/">are reporting that we are getting 1,000 more ICE agents</a>. <strong>They're asking for 10,000 more volunteers to patrol and be out on the street.</strong> Ask to get on your neighborhood Signal chats for patrols, or head to the <a href="https://twincities.fyi/pages/resources.html">Resources</a> to find a guide on how to patrol.</p>
<p>Minnesota is <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/12/latest-monday-on-ice-shooting-in-minneapolis">suing the federal government</a>, saying the government is “terrorizing Minnesota with widespread unlawful conduct.” I think anyone in the twin cities would agree with that.</p>

            <section><h3>Today</h3>
<p>The circus of fragile masculinity continues.</p>
<p><a href="https://iceout.org/">iceout.org</a> reports lots of activity across the metro today. <strong>Notably, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTYugMDkfmp/">CBP has started to block off streets</a> and go door to door.</strong> I heard of one instance where ICE presented a fake warrant and broke down a door. Make sure you know the difference between a <a href="https://40thward.org/2025/01/know-your-rights/">real warrant and a fake warrant</a> and <a href="https://unidos-mn.org/know-your-rights">know your rights</a> if someone shows up to your door. </p>
<p><strong>The Department of Homeland Security is <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/11/lawmakers-skeptical-fbi-probe-into-renee-macklin-good-shooting-ice">reportedly sending more agents</a> to Minneapolis.</strong> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/011126-face-the-nation/">Face the Nation</a> had the number at a few hundred more, for a total of 2,400 agents in Minnesota, centered around the Twin Cities. There is still more of us than there are of them. </p>
<p>Finally, this doofus <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTYxBxmEvLL/">fell on his bum</a>. Please enjoy as a moment of zen.</p>

            <section><h3>Today</h3>
<p>A huge crowd gathered for a <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/10/minneapolis-ice-agent-protest-renee-good-property-damage-officer-injury-canopy-hotel-depot">massive Anti-ICE protest in Powderhorn Park</a>. I couldn't make it, so I walked around NE with my tiny foster dog and we kept an eye out. It was good to see so many people keeping watch. </p>

<p>The Trump Administration <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-begins-surge-minnesota-trump-crackdown-somali-immigrants/">launched a surge</a> in Minnesota in December, with 2,000 officers <a href="https://www.startribune.com/what-we-know-about-the-federal-ice-surge-in-the-twin-cities/601558958">rotating through the Twin Cities</a> over a 30 day period starting January 4. On Wednesday, Jonathan Ross, an ICE agent, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/08/questions-follow-after-ice-agent-kills-renee-good-in-minneapolis">murdered Renee Macklin Good</a>.</p>
<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/ice-raids-minnesota/601546426">30 people were arrested</a> at the noise protest at the Hilton where ICE agents are staying.</p></section>
