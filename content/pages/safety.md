### Locking down your iPhone

You should lock down your iPhone so that law enforcement can't access your messages or turn off your location sharing. I wrote [a guide here](https://twincities.fyi/how-to-lock-down-your-iphone). 

### VPNs

Use a VPN for increased safety online. I wrote [an explainer](https://twincities.fyi/how-does-a-vpn-work). 

### Deflock

A [website for mapping](https://deflock.me/) where license plate reader cameras are. Avoiding these may mean avoiding ICE.
