            <section><h3>Why lock down your iPhone?</h3>
<p>If law enforcement have your phone, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/police-unlock-iphone-face-id-legal-rights/">it is legal for them to unlock your phone using your fingerprint or your face</a>. However, if your phone has a numerical password on it, it is illegal for them to compel you to tell them the code access your phone. </p>
<p>To me, this is absurd. Like, it should always be illegal to enter my home regardless if my door is locked. However, we live in a judicial system run by judges who don't understand technology. </p>
<h3>What needs to be locked?</h3>
<p>The most important thing is to take off your face or fingerprint for unlocking your phone. Personally, I don't even set it up when I get a new phone. That way, there's no danger of me accidentally turning it on. </p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the settings app of an iPhone. There are four FaceID options that are all off. FaceID has not been set up on this iPhone" src="./images/IMG_7330.png"></p>
<p>This means that you will be using your code to unlock your phone. This can seem really inconvenient at first, but once you get the muscle memory down it will take one or two seconds. </p>
<p>I have a six digit code on my phone, because in the event law enforcement want to illegally try to crack the code it will take them longer than a 4 digit code. </p>
<h3>Additional steps</h3>
<p>I also take some additional steps: I turn off Control Center, Siri, and Wallet from the lock screen. </p>
<p>If Control Center is on, law enforcement can turn on Airplane Mode without unlocking your phone. If you are detained and you are sharing location or streaming video or recording and uploading audio, putting your phone in Airplane mode can stop those activities immediately, putting you in a more dangerous position. </p>
<p>I disable Siri so that no one can as to read messages or other private data from the lock screen. I don't know exactly the threat model here, but I certainly feel better without Siri on my lock screen. </p>
<p>Then Wallet is disabled because sometimes I buy too many oat milk lattes! Sue me!</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the settings app of an iPhone. The section is called &quot;Allow Access When Locked&quot;. The toggles for Control Center, Siri, and Wallet are in the off position." src="./images/IMG_7329.png"></p></section>

            <section><h3>Today</h3>
<p><strong>There was <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/14/ice-enforcement-shooting-in-minnesota-latest-wednesday">another shooting</a> in North tonight.</strong> It seems not life-threatening to the victims. DHS is responding with armored vehicles, tear gas, and rubber bullets.</p>
<p>Last night there was a group of people in front of every business still open on Central. We stayed until closing and made sure people got home safely. So many people out and there was still an absolutely horrible and heartbreaking abduction in our neighborhood. </p>
<p><strong>Every day the schools around me are on code yellow at dismissal</strong>, meaning students are kept locked in the building. The ICE agents outside will stick around circling in their cars a while to taunt the students and teachers, until the neighbors chase them away. I'm so sad the students have to have the neighborhood show up to get them home safely. </p>
<p><strong>In talking with others doing patrols people are reporting more camera crews with ICE, some with professional cameras.</strong> I heard that this is possibly Fox News or right wing YouTubers. Either way is pretty bleak to think that this is entertainment to some people. </p>
<p><a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/anti-ice-protests-continue-with-demonstrations-at-graduate-hotel-whipple-federal-building/">People are still outside the Graduate hotel</a> making sure ICE doesn't get a good night's sleep. I still can't believe the university signed that contract. It's such a betrayal to their entire community and the principles of a university. </p>
<h3>Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Keep <a href="https://docs.proton.me/doc?mode=open-url&amp;token=NQBEQE8K60#CljXjBjfCxDo">patrolling your neighborhoods</a>.</p>
<p>Contact your local schools and see if they need help getting kids to school safely. </p>
<p>Talk to a person not on patrols and get them into patrols. </p></section>

            <section><h3>An introduction to the Internet's phone book.</h3>
<p>The Internet was built on older networks: namely, the phone network. In a phone network, you can call anyone who is connected so long as you have their phone number. Let's imagine a simple phone book: </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Phone number</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Picard</td>
<td>+33 76 43 23 45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Riker</td>
<td>+1 907 555 2384</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>O'Brien</td>
<td>+353 76 74 23 12</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If you call one of the numbers in this book, you get the person associated with that number. If you don't know someone's number, you can use this phone book to look the number up. </p>
<p>The Internet also has a phone book. It's called the Domain Name System, or DNS. In DNS, each website is associated with a number: its IP address. An IP address is like a website's phone number. </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>IP address</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>google.com</td>
<td>142.250.191.142</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>instagram.com</td>
<td>157.240.245.174</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>wikipedia.com</td>
<td>208.80.154.232</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>On the Internet, there are DNS servers that store lots of records like the ones in the table above. When you type in a web address into your browser, your computer makes a request to a DNS server to find the IP address of the website you'd like to visit. It finds the record, and you can connect to the website by making requests to its IP address. </p>
<h3>DNS and privacy</h3>
<p>This system of making a request to a DNS server presents a privacy problem. DNS requests are largely unencrypted, so that means the websites you lookup with the DNS server are public to interlopers such as your internet service provider, any system in transit between you and the DNS server, or anyone on your Wifi network (think a Wifi network at a coffee shop). </p>
<p>This means that any one of those parties can see what sites you go to and infer what you were doing. For example, if I was eavesdropping on DNS requests and I saw that a user was making a lot of DNS requests for sites on beekeeping, I could infer that they were getting into beekeeping (or already a beekeeper! Imagine!). When combined with location data such as where your network is physically located, these inferences can become very powerful. </p>
<h3>What is a VPN?</h3>
<p>A VPN stands for virtual private network. When you turn on a VPN, your computer connects to a private network and makes requests from that network instead of the network that you're connected to. </p>
<p>This means that your DNS traffic looks different. Anyone monitoring your traffic, such as an interloper on the coffee shop Wifi network or your internet service provider, does not see your DNS requests. Instead, your requests get routed first to the VPN and then to the larger Internet. </p>
<p>For example, let's say that your VPN provider allows you to select a VPN in Chicago. First, your device will establish a connection to this Chicago VPN. Once that connection is established, Internet traffic will appear to come from that address in Chicago rather than the Wifi that your device is connected to. This means that DNS requests are also sent from that VPN and are much harder to trace back to you. </p>
<h3>Safety considerations</h3>
<p>When using a VPN, you want to select a VPN provider you trust. If I wanted to get a lot of information about network traffic, I could create a virtual private network myself and advertise free VPN access. Then when users joined my VPN, I could save their device information and all their DNS requests, effectively duplicating the privacy problem they were trying to avoid by using a VPN. Be sure to only use VPNs from trusted providers like <a href="https://protonvpn.com/download">Proton</a> or <a href="https://nordvpn.com/country/usa/">NordVPN</a>.</p>
<h3>Adding a VPN you your phone.</h3>
<p>Engadget has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-iphone-201743118.html">a good guide</a> on adding the VPN to your iPhone. I don't have an Android, but <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9089766?hl=en">this support article</a> seems to be what you'll need for that platform.</p></section>

            <section><h3>Today</h3>
<p>ICE will eventually have to face whatever justice the community decides, but on top of that everyone who has ever known them will be ashamed to have even the most tenuous connection with them. </p>
<p>Today at Wrecktangle <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTbqYWQgE_n/">a crowd intimidated an agent into leaving</a>. Small wins are good and I love a crowd yelling you're not welcome here. </p>
<p>On a similar note, I heard from a friend neighbors stopped an abduction at Longfellow Park by being loud and coming out.</p>
<p>These two events may be nothing, but I think when connected to the national context of <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/shocking-poll-shows-americans-have-completely-flipped-on-ice/">deep unpopularity</a> of ICE and the Trump administration, ICE may scare easily. </p>
<p>They might even be moving hotels for the third time since December, but no news coverage on that yet. If that's true, that would be a result of the incredible negative public perception of ICE and pressure on hotels who house them. Who wants to spend money at hotels that house the Gestapo?</p>
<p>Also today <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTeIhdvjLLG/">Aliyah Rahman was detained</a> by being pulled out of her car. She was on her way to a doctor's appointment, passing through the area with ICE activity. She is a US-born citizen. They will detain anyone. </p>
<p>Here's a friend of a friend's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTeHJ-8Dz9a/">account of being detained</a>. They were able to go home, but there are many at the Whipple building that will not be able to. </p>
<p>I also heard of several heartbreaking abductions happening in my neighborhood today. I won't get into them because I think the action is the same: keep getting out as much as possible and get more people to show up. </p>

<p>This is truly the biggest bunch of losers ever assembled. Imagine having so little going for you that you resort to terrorizing a city in Amazon Basics fatigues to grasp at a feeling of importance. </p>
<p><strong>The incident yesterday wherein ICE broke down a door with a battering ram was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ice-protests-shootings-minneapolis-portland-3f9db36657dda5bfebf9c240b6011ee5">confirmed by the AP</a> to be warrantless.</strong> This could mean that they are trying this tactic elsewhere. Make sure you know the difference between a <a href="https://40thward.org/2025/01/know-your-rights/">real warrant and a fake warrant</a> and <a href="https://unidos-mn.org/know-your-rights">know your rights</a> if someone shows up to your door. </p>
<p>State Senator Doron Clark, Council Member Jason Chavez, and Council President Elliot Payne <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTb3euHjonG/">are reporting that we are getting 1,000 more ICE agents</a>. <strong>They're asking for 10,000 more volunteers to patrol and be out on the street.</strong> Ask to get on your neighborhood Signal chats for patrols, or head to the <a href="https://twincities.fyi/pages/resources.html">Resources</a> to find a guide on how to patrol.</p>
<p>Minnesota is <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/12/latest-monday-on-ice-shooting-in-minneapolis">suing the federal government</a>, saying the government is “terrorizing Minnesota with widespread unlawful conduct.” I think anyone in the twin cities would agree with that.</p>

<p>The circus of fragile masculinity continues.</p>
<p><a href="https://iceout.org/">iceout.org</a> reports lots of activity across the metro today. <strong>Notably, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTYugMDkfmp/">CBP has started to block off streets</a> and go door to door.</strong> I heard of one instance where ICE presented a fake warrant and broke down a door. Make sure you know the difference between a <a href="https://40thward.org/2025/01/know-your-rights/">real warrant and a fake warrant</a> and <a href="https://unidos-mn.org/know-your-rights">know your rights</a> if someone shows up to your door. </p>
<p><strong>The Department of Homeland Security is <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/11/lawmakers-skeptical-fbi-probe-into-renee-macklin-good-shooting-ice">reportedly sending more agents</a> to Minneapolis.</strong> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/011126-face-the-nation/">Face the Nation</a> had the number at a few hundred more, for a total of 2,400 agents in Minnesota, centered around the Twin Cities. There is still more of us than there are of them. </p>
<p>Finally, this doofus <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTYxBxmEvLL/">fell on his bum</a>. Please enjoy as a moment of zen.</p>
