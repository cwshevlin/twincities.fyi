    <h3>Today</h3>
<p>This is truly the biggest bunch of losers ever assembled. Imagine having so little going for you that you resort to terrorizing a city in Amazon Basics fatigues to grasp at a feeling of importance. </p>
<p><strong>The incident yesterday wherein ICE broke down a door with a battering ram was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ice-protests-shootings-minneapolis-portland-3f9db36657dda5bfebf9c240b6011ee5">confirmed by the AP</a> to be warrantless.</strong> This could mean that they are trying this tactic elsewhere. Make sure you know the difference between a <a href="https://40thward.org/2025/01/know-your-rights/">real warrant and a fake warrant</a> and <a href="https://unidos-mn.org/know-your-rights">know your rights</a> if someone shows up to your door. </p>
<p>State Senator Doron Clark, Council Member Jason Chavez, and Council President Elliot Payne <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTb3euHjonG/">are reporting that we are getting 1,000 more ICE agents</a>. <strong>They're asking for 10,000 more volunteers to patrol and be out on the street.</strong> Ask to get on your neighborhood Signal chats for patrols, or head to the <a href="https://twincities.fyi/pages/resources.html">Resources</a> to find a guide on how to patrol.</p>
<p>Minnesota is <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/12/latest-monday-on-ice-shooting-in-minneapolis">suing the federal government</a>, saying the government is “terrorizing Minnesota with widespread unlawful conduct.” I think anyone in the twin cities would agree with that.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Keep <a href="https://docs.proton.me/doc?mode=open-url&amp;token=NQBEQE8K60#CljXjBjfCxDo">patrolling your neighborhoods</a>.</p>
<p>Contact your local schools and see if they need help getting kids to school safely. </p>
