Summary: What happened on January 12th in the Twin Cities.

### Today

This is truly the biggest bunch of losers ever assembled. Imagine having so little going for you that you resort to terrorizing a city in Amazon Basics fatigues to grasp at a feeling of importance. 

**The incident yesterday wherein ICE broke down a door with a battering ram was [confirmed by the AP](https://apnews.com/article/ice-protests-shootings-minneapolis-portland-3f9db36657dda5bfebf9c240b6011ee5) to be warrantless.** This could mean that they are trying this tactic elsewhere. Make sure you know the difference between a [real warrant and a fake warrant](https://40thward.org/2025/01/know-your-rights/) and [know your rights](https://unidos-mn.org/know-your-rights) if someone shows up to your door. 

State Senator Doron Clark, Council Member Jason Chavez, and Council President Elliot Payne [are reporting that we are getting 1,000 more ICE agents](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTb3euHjonG/). **They're asking for 10,000 more volunteers to patrol and be out on the street.** Ask to get on your neighborhood Signal chats for patrols, or head to the [Resources](https://twincities.fyi/pages/resources.html) to find a guide on how to patrol.

Minnesota is [suing the federal government](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/12/latest-monday-on-ice-shooting-in-minneapolis), saying the government is “terrorizing Minnesota with widespread unlawful conduct.” I think anyone in the twin cities would agree with that.

### Tomorrow

Keep [patrolling your neighborhoods](https://docs.proton.me/doc?mode=open-url&token=NQBEQE8K60#CljXjBjfCxDo).

Contact your local schools and see if they need help getting kids to school safely.
