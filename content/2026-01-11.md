Summary: What happened on January 11th in the Twin Cities.

### Today

The circus of fragile masculinity continues.

[iceout.org](https://iceout.org/) reports lots of activity across the metro today. **Notably, [CBP has started to block off streets](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTYugMDkfmp/) and go door to door.** I heard of one instance where ICE presented a fake warrant and broke down a door. Make sure you know the difference between a [real warrant and a fake warrant](https://40thward.org/2025/01/know-your-rights/) and [know your rights](https://unidos-mn.org/know-your-rights) if someone shows up to your door. 

**The Department of Homeland Security is [reportedly sending more agents](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/11/lawmakers-skeptical-fbi-probe-into-renee-macklin-good-shooting-ice) to Minneapolis.** [Face the Nation](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/011126-face-the-nation/) had the number at a few hundred more, for a total of 2,400 agents in Minnesota, centered around the Twin Cities. There is still more of us than there are of them. 

Finally, this doofus [fell on his bum](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTYxBxmEvLL/). Please enjoy as a moment of zen.

### Tomorrow

Keep [patroling your neighborhoods](https://docs.proton.me/doc?mode=open-url&token=NQBEQE8K60#CljXjBjfCxDo).


### Previously

[January 10th](https://twincities.fyi/january-tenth)

A huge crowd gathered for a [massive Anti-ICE protest in Powderhorn Park](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/10/minneapolis-ice-agent-protest-renee-good-property-damage-officer-injury-canopy-hotel-depot). I couldn't make it, so I walked around NE with my tiny foster dog and we kept an eye out. It was good to see so many people keeping watch.
