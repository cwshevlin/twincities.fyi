Summary: What happened on January 13th in the Twin Cities.

### Today

ICE will eventually have to face whatever justice the community decides, but on top of that everyone who has ever known them will be ashamed to have even the most tenuous connection with them. 

Today at Wrecktangle [a crowd intimidated an agent into leaving](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTbqYWQgE_n/). Small wins are good and I love a crowd yelling you're not welcome here. 

On a similar note, I heard from a friend neighbors stopped an abduction at Longfellow Park by being loud and coming out.

These two events may be nothing, but I think when connected to the national context of [deep unpopularity](https://www.thedailybeast.com/shocking-poll-shows-americans-have-completely-flipped-on-ice/) of ICE and the Trump administration, ICE may scare easily. 

They might even be moving hotels for the third time since December, but no news coverage on that yet. If that's true, that would be a result of the incredible negative public perception of ICE and pressure on hotels who house them. Who wants to spend money at hotels that house the Gestapo?

Also today [Aliyah Rahman was detained](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTeIhdvjLLG/) by being pulled out of her car. She was on her way to a doctor's appointment, passing through the area with ICE activity. She is a US-born citizen. They will detain anyone. 

Here's a friend of a friend's [account of being detained](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTeHJ-8Dz9a/). They were able to go home, but there are many at the Whipple building that will not be able to. 

I also heard of several heartbreaking abductions happening in my neighborhood today. I won't get into them because I think the action is the same: keep getting out as much as possible and get more people to show up. 


### Tomorrow

Keep [patrolling your neighborhoods](https://docs.proton.me/doc?mode=open-url&token=NQBEQE8K60#CljXjBjfCxDo).

Contact your local schools and see if they need help getting kids to school safely. 

Talk to a person not on patrols and get them into patrols.
