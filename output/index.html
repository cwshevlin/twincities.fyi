            <section><h3>Previously</h3>
<p>The Trump Administration <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-begins-surge-minnesota-trump-crackdown-somali-immigrants/">launced a surge</a> in Minnesota in December, with 2,000 officers <a href="https://www.startribune.com/what-we-know-about-the-federal-ice-surge-in-the-twin-cities/601558958">rotating through the Twin Cities</a> over a 30 day period starting January 4. On Wednesday, Jonathan Ross, an ICE agent, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/08/questions-follow-after-ice-agent-kills-renee-good-in-minneapolis">murdered Renee Macklin Good</a>.</p>
<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/ice-raids-minnesota/601546426">30 people were arrested</a> at the noise protest at the Hilton where ICE agents are staying.</p>
<h3>Today</h3>
<p>A huge crowd gathered for a <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/10/minneapolis-ice-agent-protest-renee-good-property-damage-officer-injury-canopy-hotel-depot">massive Anti-ICE protest in Powderhorn Park</a>. I couldn't make it, so I walked around NE with my tiny foster dog and we kept an eye out. It was good to see so many people keeping watch. </p>
<h3>Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Keep <a href="https://docs.proton.me/doc?mode=open-url&amp;token=NQBEQE8K60#CljXjBjfCxDo">patroling your neighborhoods</a>.</p></section>
