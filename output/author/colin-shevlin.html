            <section><h3>Today</h3>
<p>The circus of fragile masculinity continues.</p>
<p><a href="https://iceout.org/">iceout.org</a> reports lots of activity across the metro today. <strong>Notably, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTYugMDkfmp/">CBP has started to block off streets</a> and go door to door.</strong> I heard of one instance where ICE presented a fake warrant and broke down a door. Make sure you know the difference between a <a href="https://40thward.org/2025/01/know-your-rights/">real warrant and a fake warrant</a> and <a href="https://unidos-mn.org/know-your-rights">know your rights</a> if someone shows up to your door. </p>
<p><strong>The Department of Homeland Security is <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/11/lawmakers-skeptical-fbi-probe-into-renee-macklin-good-shooting-ice">reportedly sending more agents</a> to Minneapolis.</strong> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/011126-face-the-nation/">Face the Nation</a> had the number at a few hundred more, for a total of 2,400 agents in Minnesota, centered around the Twin Cities. There is still more of us than there are of them. </p>
<p>Finally, this doofus <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTYxBxmEvLL/">fell on his bum</a>. Please enjoy as a moment of zen.</p>

            <section><h3>Today</h3>
<p>A huge crowd gathered for a <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/10/minneapolis-ice-agent-protest-renee-good-property-damage-officer-injury-canopy-hotel-depot">massive Anti-ICE protest in Powderhorn Park</a>. I couldn't make it, so I walked around NE with my tiny foster dog and we kept an eye out. It was good to see so many people keeping watch. </p>
